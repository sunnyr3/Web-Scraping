"6,690",Help Shelby! Medical Expenses & Liver Transplant,Canadian Dollar,,of $20k goal,33,"My close friend Shelby Gielen ( Miller) is not one to ask for help with anything… so it is at this time that
    I am asking you for help on her behalf. As some of you may already
    know, Shelby, a two-time liver transplant recipient, has just found
    out that her current liver is in a late stage of chronic rejection.
    She is going to need another liver transplant in the near future and
    she is already in late stage liver cirrhosis. Over the past few years, Shelby has been suffering terribly from
    other health issues as well. Shelby developed Atypical Trigeminal
    Neuralgia which is a chronic pain condition that affects the
    trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from your face to your
    brain. Her Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia (ATN) has progressed to the
    point where she suffers from more frequent bouts of searing pain
    forcing her to significantly cut back on her jewelry designs. Shelby
    has been in and out of pain clinics and hospital for surgeries to
    try and help with the pain for over a year. Her most recent surgery
    for this was in early June 2018 and more will be needed to control
    the facial nerve pain that she refers to as “an ice cream head ache
    that just doesn’t ever go away”. Shelby is a fighter and no one would know by looking at her that
    she was suffering from severe chronic pain or in need of another
    transplant. Knowing the state of her liver, she just won 4 medals at
    the Canadian Transplant Games last month in swimming. She is a strong, motivated, and the most compassionate woman
    you’ll meet who needs our help to show her she is supported in this
    next journey she has to go through. She will never ask for it, so I
    will for her… I am asking you all to help raise $20,000 for Shelby’s
    upcoming medical expenses, prescriptions, bills, hospital parking,
    gas money to VGH, after-transplant care, post-transplant
    accommodations, and more as she prepares for this next medical
    hurdle. Financial worry should not be something she has to stress
    over during this time. She needs to focus on her health and getting
    a new liver. I know Shelby will be more than grateful and so will I. Together
    we can all make this easier for her and ultimately help save her life. (Photo Credits: David Fournier, Scott Gielen, Gerard Gielen,

"5,284",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,110,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes
"6,420",URGENTLY NEEDED New Hips for Christian McCudden!!,Australian Dollar,"Aug 14, 2018",of $81k goal,23,"Hi, my wife and I have been friends with Christian and Melissa for nearly
    twenty years... it has been many years since we have caught up with
    this wonderful family and after a recent phone conversation with
    Christian we have only just now learned of the ongoing physical
    hardship he has been going through over the years and the very
    difficult decision he has just had to make..... After our chat I thought there has to be something we can do to
    help, so I have setup this campaign in the hope that you will all
    join us in standing together to make a massive difference to
    Christian’s upcoming journey! Following is a snapshot of the McCudden family and Christian’s
    journey so far and the reasons why our donations are so very vital
    and impactful at this time for them... Christian has been married to Melissa for 21 yrs. and they have
    3 three amazing children, Noah, Ella and Zachary. In 2013 Christian & Melissa moved from their home in
    Sydney's northern beaches leaving family, friends and working at C3
    Oxford falls as one of the full time pastors, and planted C3 church
    Noosa, launching in May of 2013. Prior to planting C3 Noosa they were a part of C3 Oxford falls
    for 20 years. Over that time Christian fulfilled many roles in various
  areas including: Youth ministry for 12yrs / Pastoring / Lecturing in the Bible College. Travelled with and assisted Ps Phil for 6 years. Project managed the buildings and renovations that went on over the
  years at C3 Oxford falls. Christian has also over many years ministered in Church's throughout
  Australia, New Zealand, America, Europe, Asia and Indonesia seeing
  many people saved, healed and touched by the power of God. He has also seen over the year’s incredible healings and testimonies. Blind eyes opened / Deaf ears opened / Cancer healed Crippled people getting out of wheel chairs / Stroke patients healed
  and walking and speaking. Pain leaving bodies immediately / Blood conditions healed / People
  who were suicidal set free Dead raised to life / Arthritis conditions healed Broken bones healed instantly… and many more stories to be told. Christian and Melissa have now been on the Sunshine Coast QLD for 5
  1/2 years with C3 Noosa just celebrating its 5th birthday.  A church
  that is vibrant, growing, and impacting many lives in their local
  community and beyond. As this all still continues to grow and function
  Christian currently works part time for their church C3 Noosa and full
  time as a carpenter, building on job sites. Over the past 8 years Christian has
    suffered with pain in his body from a gradual degenerative arthritic
    condition in both his hips. In the past 4 years the pain has become
    very intense with major side effects such as only being able to
    sleep a couple of sound hours a night, having limited movement,
    unable to exercise or do the physical things he loves to do and
    especially with his kids. Two years ago Christian had the
    opportunity to go over to the U.S to get stem cell treatment in both
    hips which has helped to a small degree but has not been able to see
    the full benefits due to his current working activity of being on
    the tools building. Building over the last few years
      has taken a huge toll on his body and made the pain more intense.
      Christian has now come to a place where he cannot physically
      continue to do his work labouring as a builder, due to the extreme
      pain and limited movement. He has no other option left other than to proceed with
      further treatment being a double hip replacement! A double hip replacement and the extensive rehabilitation
        involved is quite costly and the road to full recovery is a good
        6 to12 months! In a matter of days Christian will have no income from building as he has had to give notice and quit due to his bodies inability
    to function sufficiently in the way needed to perform his role as a
    builder and his bodies pain levels have reached a crippling level. Christian needs our help NOW! The results from this will be amazing! It will give Christian back his quality of life! It will give
      him back the things that we take for granted like having a full
      night’s sleep, having no crippling pain, being able to exercise,
      and the ability to do normal life activities with his children
      while they are still young! We would love to enable Christian to get this surgery done ASAP
      and for him to have the appropriate time required for a full recovery. It is a costly procedure and the post-operative rehabilitation
      expenses required will be quite high. To enable Christian to have the procedure and the necessary
        time off not needing to labour physically in the building
        industry is a minimum of six months..... So that’s what we have
        based the amount of funds needed to raise on: - The double hip
        replacement surgery, rehabilitation and physical therapy for six
        months and funds to keep the family afloat while Christian is
        unable to work. So we kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless
        Christian and his family at this time as they make plans towards
        treatment, surgery and rehabilitation. Christian has been such a faithful servant and blessing to so
      many lives over the years. A servant’s heart through and through
      and one of the most generous people you will ever meet. If you are reading this then you have probably been blessed in
        some form either directly or indirectly from the big hearted
        kindness of this faithful man. We now we get the opportunity to sow back into this rich soil of
    an amazing family and help them in their time of need! They are so humble and never complain most people wouldn’t even
      know about this ongoing struggle over the years and how Christian
      has been enduring such pain in his body while going about blessing others! Let’s all band together to quickly raise the funds for this
        much needed surgery! If we all dig deep, give what we can and pass this on to our
        various friends and networks then Christian will be on the road
        to recovery before we know it... Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations.... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1MWCb
"3,160",Please help Maria beat Syringomyelia,Canadian Dollar,"Aug 9, 2018",of $10k goal,40,"My family and I have made this campaign in the hopes of not
    only receiving support but to also gain awareness for a supposedly
    ""rare"" disease. Since I was diagnosed, I have gotten in
    touch with patients from all over the world who have the same
    condition, and most people are misdiagnosed, or their symptoms are
    disregarded for years (as was my case). Creating awareness is so
    important to help others recognize signs and get proper treatment in
    time. Thank you for checking out my campaign, and I would be so
    grateful for your contribution! Have you ever heard of Arnold Chiari Syndrome and
    Syringomyelia? Probably not; I had no idea what it was until I was diagnosed in 2016! In my best efforts to sum it up, I have a malformation in the base of
  my skull that compresses my cerebellum and medulla. As a result,
  cerebral fluid is trapped inside my spinal cord, which is slowly
  killing off nerves that are vital for my organs and extremities to
  function properly. What are the symptoms and repercussions? The most severe outcome is tetraplegia. There are many symptoms, but
  some are chronic neck and back pain, loss of muscle strength, vertigo,
  migraines, partial or total paralysis of my arms, legs and torso. At
  the moment, I have already lost sensitivity to heat or cold (I can
  burn myself easily), am losing reflexes in my arms and legs, motor
  control and strength, and I live in constant neck and back pain, let
  alone face annoying headaches. Surgery needs to be done as soon as
  possible to prevent my symptoms from getting worse before it is too late. Is there a cure or treatment? Apparently, there is no cure. However, its progression can be
  controlled or even reversed through a surgery that consists of cutting
  the Filum Terminale - a ligament that connects the spinal cord and spine. The CHIARI Institute located in Barcelona is the pioneer of this
  minimally invasive surgical procedure. I went to Spain in May with my
  parents for a consultation, and fortunately, their surgical team
  confirmed that I am a candidate for treatment! The cost of the surgery
  abroad is very expensive (approx $44,000), however, I have been lucky
  enough to find a neurosurgeon in Brazil who is offering the same
  treatment. Unfortunately, this surgery is not offered in Canada. The second and most common treatment in attempts to control the
  disease is decompressive craniectomy brain surgery. I faced this
  high-risk and extremely painful surgery in 2016, but unfortunately, my
  symptoms have continued to progress. For more information on Chiari and Syringomyelia and its treatment,

"590,902",British Gut,,,,,"There will be a delay in sending out British Gut orders until
    8/15.  Apologies for the inconvenience. This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within three weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your sample to us, the samples will be
  processed and analysed by the Knight Lab at University of California,
  San Diego and you will be provided with a list of the major groups of
  bacteria in your sample and the proportions in which they are found.
  We estimate that this will take around 3 months from the time your
  sample is scanned into our lab (but possibly longer) and once we
  provide you with your results, you will be able to see how your
  bacterial community compares to others in the study. From the diet and
  lifestyle information that you provide, we will also be able to show
  you how your results compare to other people who are within the same
  diet and lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to
  them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you
  have experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your
  bacterial profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information/advice related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"4,780",Steve Roberts: Cancer Treatment Appeal,Pound Sterling,"Aug 21, 2018",of £7.5k goal,81,"My dear friend Steve Roberts has just been diagnosed with cancer in
  his prostate. I'm fundraising to help him and his wife Susanna afford
  the inpatient treatment he's been offered at the end of July at the
  Camphill Wellbeing Trust Medical Centre in Aberdeen and its follow-up
  maintenance programme. This intensive protocol is widely used in
  Europe and will double his chances of a good recovery by boosting his
  immune system as well as targeting the cancer cells. Donations of any
  size are vitally needed and will be much appreciated. Thank you! In most men, prostate cancer is slow growing and merely kept under
  observation but Steve's has an aggressive element that needs treatment
  to stop it spreading. The Gleason Score grades prostate cancers on a
  scale of 2-10 and his MRI and recent biopsy results reveal a Grade 7
  tumour. It is currently localised and Stage 2. As his beloved wife
  Susanna lost both her father and her mother to cancer they're
  determined to maximise Steve's chances by using conventional and complementary medicine this time. The intensive Mistletoe protocol at CWT Aberdeen is a holistic,
  plant-based, whole-person approach which, in our opinion and according
  to research and scientific evidence, strengthens the immune system and
  the life force while directly tackling the tumour. We believe it will
  give him the best chance of surviving this disease and retaining a
  good quality of life. When I met with Steve and Susanna last Summer at Emerson College,
  Forest Row (below) we were pleased to find each other looking so well. Steve had only just
  retired the previous December. His five-decade long working life was
  split equally between the written word (as a journalist, book &
  magazine publisher, editor and book seller) and curative education
  (first as a Carer and House Father in residential homes at Hohepa, New
  Zealand and Bristol, then as a teacher, Letter Press  tutor,
  Administrator and Trustee in special needs education). He and I met
  when we worked together in staff development for Ruskin Mill Trust at
  their Freeman College site in Sheffield, but he seems twice as busy in retirement. Steve is now on the verge of completing his first book - about
  Creativity and the Writer's Muse - with a second one planned (on
  William Golding and the double) while simultaneously organising an
  international conference on Nature Spirits, Elemental Beings and
    Human Cooperation scheduled for May 2019, and giving public
  talks and workshops on a variety of subjects. You will probably remember this fizzy
    combination of positivity, energy, enthusiasm and wide-ranging
    curiosity from your own dealings with him! Please help me to help this husband, brother, stepfather,
    larger-than-life Kiwi and inspiring friend to very many people
    around the world get on with the job of living his life to the full
    while trying to improve it for others. Every single penny donated will be spent
  on Steve's inpatient treatment in July, his ongoing home injection
  maintenance programme and his recovery. Your positive thoughts, prayers and messages of support are
      equally valuable. Steve's email is steveroberts1151@gmail.com . He is currently feeling fine and is his

"1,039",Help Nadia pay for gender affirming surgeries,Euro,"Sep 26, 2018",of €4k goal,27,"Hi there. My name is Nadia . I'm a neurodiverse
  transgender woman of color living The Netherlands. I was assigned male at birth, but for most of my life, especially
  since I started puberty I've been suffering from crippling dysphoria regarding my gender. Along with my ADHD , this led to me developing chronic
    depression, anxiety and agoraphobia in my late teens and
  young adulthood. Eventually I couldn't take it any more and realized
  that the only way I could ever be truly happy is to transition and start living as my most authentic self. I’ve lived in this body for 31 years, of which only the last 3 I've
  been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) . This,
  along with things like permanent laser facial hair
  removal has gone a long way towards helping me look and feel
  like the woman I know I am. But there's only so much that hormones can
  do. It can't fix the parts of my body that cause me the most
  dysphoria. Only surgery can change those. When I first started transition, I didnt want to rush into any
  surgeries. After all, they're scary, permanent, invasive and very
  expensive. I was hoping HRT alone would be enough. But over the past 3
  years the pain I feel regarding these specific aspects of my body has
  been constant and persistent regardless of how much
  self love I try to practice. It’s not something that’s just
    going to go away on its own. Deciding on getting these procedures isn't a decision I made lightly.
  It came after years of deliberation and trying everything else I could
  think of to make this feeling go away. Over the past 9 months especially, my mental health has gone down the
  drain. A lot of the time I'm too scared to go outside by myself,
  because how transphobic society can be to someone like me. My loved
  ones, family members, and partners have noticed how much worse I've
  gotten. I've been feeling hopeless, gross and most of all stuck. Like
  I'm unable to move forward in any way. Just like my decision to come out and transition, the decision to get
  rid of my facial hair using laser hair removal, the decision to go on
  HRT, having these surgeries really is the best
  option. It’s the next step I need to take in my transition. Please consider donating if you’re able to. It would mean
      the world to me and you’d be helping me out in a big way. If
      you’re unable to donate please share the link as much as possible. Thank you. <3",https://fundrazr.com/helpnadia

    boys, Rebecca Nowak was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ER+
    and HER2+ an aggressive form of Breast Cancer .  When we
  received the news our worlds were flipped upside down to say the
  least.  I rushed home from work to put my arms around my wife and
  process this new reality, and within an hour received a call from the
  oncologist to come in and begin a plan of action on how we would treat
  the Cancer.  Those of you that know Rebecca know that we truly believe
  in Alternative and Natural ways of Healing, so we were caught in a
  circumstance that we needed more time to process.  We began praying
  and asking God for guidance on this Journey, and to align us with the
  right people/places, and the wisdom to make whatever decision He
  wanted us to make to get Rebecca well.  After much prayer, Receiving
  ""Signs"" and doing tons of research regarding Natural
  Treatments for Cancer we decided to send my wife to an Alternative
  Cancer Center in Tijuana Mexico. (To Read The Full Story of What Led
  us to Mexico Scroll to the bottom section of this page) Since the Diagnosis, and the First trip to Mexico, we discovered that
  the Cancer has Tripled in size, Metastasized to her Lymph nodes and
  possibly her liver.  We are at a point where we need to combat this
  cancer full force but are running out of funds to do so.  Meanwhile,
  The Cancer continues to takes it's toll on Rebecca's body.  This
  morning at 4am I woke up to find my wife sobbing by my side and
  telling me that she's scared and that her whole body hurts, especially
  her liver and back.  The Cancer is growing at a pace greater than the
  treatment that we have been able to give her up to now.  We need to
  get Rebecca to Mexico for an extended stay of 3-4 weeks where she will
  be monitored constantly and given the most aggressive treatments

  Cancer due to a suspicious lump in her breast.  She was given a clean
  bill of health and told by the Thermographer that it was nothing to be
  concerned with and not Cancer.  We were relieved at that point and
  went on with our lives but the lump continued to increase in size. 
  Five Months Later on April 3rd we scheduled a Biopsy which confirmed
  that it was in fact Grade 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ER+ and HER2+. 
  The news was devastating and we began to pray for signs and direction
  from God on what to do next.  After weeks of doing it on our own with
  a strict diet change, supplements, and cleansing the lymphatic system,
  with no real improvement, we realized that we needed to get my wife in
  the care of specialists.   Rebecca decided to call the Thermographer
  to let her know that she misdiagnosed us, she apologized and explained
  that most scan and tests are never 100% accurate and they always
  recommend a second opinion if we have concerns.  She also told Rebecca
  that she understood what she was going through because 30 years ago
  she was diagnosed with breast cancer and she beat it naturally at an
  Alternative Treatment Center in Tijuana, Mexico.  Then she proceeded
  to tell Rebecca that she had sent over 500 patients to this clinic in
  the past 15 years and they have all been healed naturally of Cancer. The following morning I was looking through unpacked boxes (We had
  just finished a move to Idaho from California when she was diagnosed)
  trying to find a power cord for the printer to print up some
  documents, with no luck.  On the 20th or so box that I cut open, I
  found a white bag with a bright yellow business card in it.  The color
  of the card caught my attention so I picked it up.  The business card
  was for the same clinic in Mexico and on the back of the card, it read
  Ogden, IA. I was in awe, so I asked my wife where
  she got this card from?  She was blown away to and had forgotten all
  about the card.  She proceeded to tell me that an older gentleman that
  used to come into her work in Iowa gave it to her and said, ""If you, or anyone that you know ever gets cancer, you
    should go to this place, they saved my life and they can save
  yours"" .  Rebecca had this card for 12 years.  It made it
  from Iowa, to 4 different homes in California and now to Idaho to be
  found within hours of hearing about this clinic for the first time
  ever from the Thermographer. Four days later, I was at a swap meet in Garden City, ID.  Within a
  few minutes of being there, I see a guy wearing a Classic Ford Bronco
  Shirt which catches my attention because I sell Classic Ford Bronco
  parts for a living and I own a Classic Ford Bronco, so I say,
  ""Hey man, I like your shirt"" After talking Trucks with him
  for a few minutes, we find out that I have sold him parts in the past
  and he knew who I was. I explained the situation to him about my wife
  and he proceeds to tell me about his mother passed from Breast
  Cancer.  When I told him that we were sending my wife to an
  Alternative Treatment Center in Mexico, his face lit up and he
  proceeds to tell me that his friends wife was battling Cancer for
  years and had been given 3 weeks to live by her
  Dr’s. They wanted to give her one more round of
  Chemo in hopes that it would help, but she refused.  With nothing else
  to lose, she decided to go to a treatment center in Mexico which ended
  up being the same Clinic that my wife and I are going to, and is alive
  and well today",https://fundrazr.com/e1Nbl6
"14,365",Drew’s leukemia fight,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,137,"Drew Aufderheide was diagnosed with a rare and incurable form of
  Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) .  Only 5,000 per year in the United
  States are diagnosed with this disease and because the cancer is
  caused by a chromosomal change, there is no way to cure it - only
  medication to keep it at bay.  At the age of 33, it is extremely rare
  for someone like Drew to have this form of leukemia.  It is normally
  diagnosed in people with an average age of 67, and the life expectancy
  is approximately 15 years. There are currently a lot of unknown facts
  surrounding Drew's case because physicians and oncologists do not
  often see CML in someone so young and because of Drew's young age, his
  life expectancy is unknown. What is known, is that Drew needs to take a maintenance chemo
  drug/pill each day to manage the CML for the rest of his life, or
  until a cure is discovered.  There are only a few drugs available at
  this time to treat this disease and Drew's body has already rejected
  3.  He is on the last and 4th drug that is available at this time and
  because it is so rare the demand for the drug is low.  The medication
  he is on now comes from Switzerland, the only place it is made.  The
  doctor orders it through a lab in New Jersey, it is then
  mailed directly to Drew. This medication is not available through a pharmacy. Because of the low demand, the cost for Drew's medication is
  approximately $11,000 per/month.  Medical Insurance and grants pay a
  portion of the entire cost of the drug, so Drew is faced with finding
  funding to make up the balance.  This disease has been an incredible
  financial strain on Drew and his wife Val. With this medication comes
  side effects that he must manage.  Drew has met this challenge with
  his usual strength of determination, peace of soul, his faith in God
  and warm and loving demeanor. Drew is very grateful for the prayers and financial support people
  have shown him in the past.  Financially, the importance of any
  monetary gifts cannot be overstated.  It has allowed him to pay for
  the medication to keep him alive.  From a faith viewpoint, he cannot
  thank you all enough for your prayers.  He knows from experience that
  prayer works.  During this last year when weeks of side effects have
  kept him in bed unable to work, he felt your love and prayers.",https://fundrazr.com/exjqd
